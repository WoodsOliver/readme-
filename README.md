# About Me
Although I'm only a 15-year-old guy who usually lies on a couch listening to music, I have big life plans and a wide range of knowledge, especially in science and general topics.

### Interests and Hobbies 
I absolutely love reading scientific articles and Wikipedia pages. Some of my "first ones" were "Precession of the perihelion of Mercury" and "Kepler's laws of planetary motion". I also enjoy reading in Russian, especially detective and historical novels. My other hobbies include playing tennis and studying (yeah, I do count it as a hobby).

### Languages  
Here are the languages I speak, with my approximate levels:

English - B2+, 
Russian - C2-, 
Ukrainian - B2+, 
Czech - B2+, 
German - A2, 
French and Spanish are coming soon (I hope I’ll have time to learn them).

### Background 
I’m a native Ukrainian from Dnipro who moved to the Czech Republic in 2022 because of the war.

### Education Goals  
In the future, I plan to apply to universities that match my interests, such as CU Boulder, MIT, Caltech, Stanford, Imperial College, and ETH Zurich. (I know these are very high standards, but don't you think I'll do my best, ha?)

### About my interests 
Currently the main targets of mine are astrophysics and chemistry. In future I want to turn them into Aerospace Engineering or Chemical Engineering (honestly, I’m still deciding).

### Other Facts  
My MBTI type is IxTJ. In September, I will start studying in a gymnazium. I have almost no friends, but I’m always open to meeting new people.
